### About Me ###
About me...

Well, not much to be said - I'm a wife and parent, member of the LGBTQIA+ community, certified computer nerd, and gaming geek!

I also enjoy writing and sharing my thoughts on various things, mostly to do with geekery.

To read is to learn, to write is to create, to love is to live!
