_"They hear the howls and know fear" - Saladin, Destiny 2_

Today's deck is the fifth entry for the Innistrad block! In classic Red/Green fashion, you'll be playing creatures and smashing face with them! That said, these werewolves have some conditions in order to maximize their power. First, every werewolf in this deck starts in their human form. In order to transform you either need to have a turn where no spells were played or you drop a <span class="mtgcard">Moonmist</span> during an opponent's turn for a vicious reprisal! Once transformed, your werewolves are larger and often have additional abilities as well.

Watch for your wolf friends too; <span class="mtgcard">Immerwolf</span> provides +1/+1 to other wolves and weres, preventing the later from reverting to their weaker forms. Deny opportunities to block by attacking with <span class="mtgcard">Pyreheart Wolf</span> or drop a<span class="mtgcard">Full Moon's Rise</span> to give your wolf-pack trample! Dominate the combat step and this deck will win!
