The ruling class of Innistrad makes their debut in this deck! The vampires of the houses Falkenrath, Markov, and Stromkirk all are here to demonstrate their dominance and nobility.

This deck is a classically aggro deck, with a strong focus on getting past your opponent's defenses! You see, many of these vampires will feed on your opponent, gaining +1/+1 counters every time they deal combat damage to a player.

Further the growth of your vampire army by using <span class="mtgcard">Stromkirk Captain</span> and <span class="mtgcard">Rakish Heir</span>; The captain's first strike benefit will put opposing forces on the back foot!

To relish the sweet taste of victory, bring in large threats like <span class="mtgcard">Markov Warlord</span> or <span class="mtgcard">Olivia Voldaren</span> . Olivia allows you to lay waste to your opponent's creatures by draining them dry or converting them to your cause!
