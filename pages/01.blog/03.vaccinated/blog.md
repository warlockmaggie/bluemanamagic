Been a busy few weeks, with this past week being my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. While it did knock me down for a few days, the knowledge that I was doing my part to help my family and community made it bareable!

The second wave of Innistrad decks should be forthcoming this month. 

Thanks all!
