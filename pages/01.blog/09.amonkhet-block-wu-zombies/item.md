Welcome to the plane of Amonkhet! The next 5 decks cover the themes and mechanics of this suspicious sandy plane!

This White/Blue deck focuses on a combination of the Embalm and Eternalize mechanics that turn your departed creatures into token copies of themselves but as Mummies (ok, technically *Zombies*)! <span class="mtgcard">Temmet, Vizier of Naktamun</span> and <span class="mtgcard">Aven Wind Guide</span> are key to strengthening your tokens, while cards like <span card="mtgcard">Embalmer's Tools</span> help make the costs to bring your creatures back lower.

Your opponent(s) will be hard pressed to prevent your win when death is an intended part of your game plan!
