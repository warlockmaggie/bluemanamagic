Unlike most decks focusing on counters, this Black-Green deck goes all in on -1/-1 counters! Whether you put them on your creatures as an added cost or on opposing creatures, there are a few key synergies to look out for: <span class="mtgcard">Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons</span> and <span class="mtgcard">Nest of Scarabs</span> begin filling your field with Snakes and Insects both giving you fodder for your counters as well as supercharging <span card="mtgcard">Majestic Myriarch</span>! Additionally, you can start whittling away at life totals with <span card="mtgcard">Obelisk Spider</span> or opposing fields with  <span class="mtgcard">Decimator Beetle</span>! Let your supposed weakness be a strength that you unleash upon your foes!
