The second deck of the ten Innistrad block decks features the ghoulish monstrosities of Diregraf and Havengul! As with most tribal decks, you're going to look for ways to synergize the tandem concepts of filling your graveyard and consuming it for additional costs for creatures like <span class="mtgcard">Skaab Goliath</span> or <span class="mtgcard">Stitched Drake.</span>

Start your game by filling your graveyard either through early creature deaths or cards like <span class="mtgcard">Thought Scour</span> and <span class="mtgcard">Forbidden Alchemy</span> . Once your graveyard begins to fill up, start dropping your bigger threats!

Closing the game will require sowing up the seams on your Skaabs and/or dropping <span class="mtgcard">Havengul Lich</span> to steal creatures right out of any graveyard on the board!
