*Does a celebratory dance...*

As readers may have noticed, I fixed the tappedout issue and my deck lists are loading once more!

For the next little bit, we'll be looking at Innistrad, the gothic horror block that is beloved by many players! A plane of humans trying to eek out their lives while surviving a ruling class of vampires that treat them as cattle. When it's not vampires, they're avoiding a seedy assortment of zombies and their masters or the many geists that haunt the holy and hellish places of the plane! But even within their own ranks, vicious werewolves hide their true forms until the full moon rises!

Innistrad Humans is a very interesting tribal deck. Coming in a variety of color combinations, each handling just a bit different than the others. As you'll see, each human deck will show a different side, from survival to vengeance; from ingenuity to depravity.

This is the GW variant that looks to utilize the number of creatures you control to increase power through cards like<span class="mtgcard">Mikaeus, the Lunarch</span> and <span class="mtgcard">Elder of Laurels</span> . As these humans are trying to protect themselves from the monsters of Innistrad, you'll see cards that specifically target non-Human creatures like Zombies, Werewolves, etc. <span class="mtgcard">Slayer of the Wicked</span> provides targeted removal whereas <span class="mtgcard">Bonds of Faith</span> can either be a boon to your creatures and a bane to your opponent's!

If the battle is looking dire, there are a number of cards with *Fateful Hour*, granting additional bonuses to the spell and/or your creatures. Close out the game with <span class="mtgcard">Faith's Shield</span> by granting protection and attack with possibly *unblockable* creatures. Show the plane of Innistrad that you will not go quietly into the night!
