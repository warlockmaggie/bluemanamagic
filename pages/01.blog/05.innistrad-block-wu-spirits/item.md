Deck #4 is frightfully filled with solemn spirits who seek to scare!
This deck may not have the largest creatures, but due to their ghostly natures, they are able to float above the battlefield with ease! Combine your flyers with cards like [Battleground Geist] or [Gallows Warden] to provide a +1/+1 boost! Landing a [Drogskol Captain] not only increases your spirits' strength but also renders your opponents unable to target your army!
These geists have yet more tricks to play. Utilize the non-creatures spells (like [Feeling of Dread] ) in this deck to keep opponents off-balance as you tap, bounce, and even possess their creatures!
